Possible Features:
Voice or Text-Based Commands – The assistant might process user input (voice/text) and respond accordingly.
Contact Management – Since there is a contacts.csv file, it may store and retrieve contact information.
Database Integration – The jarvis.db file suggests that the assistant saves data persistently.
Modular Design – The presence of engine/ indicates separate modules handling different tasks.
Web Interface – The web/ directory hints at possible web-based control.
Virtual Environment (envchintan/) – Shows that it uses a controlled Python environment for dependencies.
Key Files & Their Roles:
jarvis.py – Likely the main assistant logic where user commands are processed.
run.py – Possibly the entry point to start the assistant.
contacts.csv – Stores contact information.
jarvis.db – A SQLite database that may store user interactions or settings.
engine/ – Might contain functional modules like speech recognition, command processing, etc.
web/ – Could contain files for a web-based interface.
.gitignore – Used for version control, likely to exclude unnecessary files (like logs, cache, or environment files).
How It Likely Works:
The user interacts with the assistant (via voice or text).
Chintan.py processes the command.
It may check contacts.csv (for contact-related queries) or jarvis.db (for stored data).
It executes tasks through modules inside engine/.
If web integration is enabled, it might interact with web/.
